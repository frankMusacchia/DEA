#File configuration for gea 0.1
# It contains parameters that are used very often but very rarely by the user. 
# We collected the parameters in RARELY CHANGED which means that an expert user can decide to change
# and VERY RARELY CHANGED because it is very rare that an user wants to change
# READ CAREFULLY!!!
# This file has been written with a specific sintax. 
# The variables MUST stay in the form: variable = value
# A series of hashes (#########) closes the parameters to read
# Parameters of BLAST programs without a value assigned will not be used
# When you want to execute something you have to write YES (in upper case) or NO otherwise
# other strings will give error.
# THIS FILE SHOULD BE CHANGED ONLY IF YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!
